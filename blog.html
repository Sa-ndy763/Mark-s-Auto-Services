            <h1 class="heading1">WHAT IS DIESEL EXHAUST FLUID</h1>

                <p class="pp6">
                    Diesel exhaust fluid is used to help break down the hazardous nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentration in emissions from your diesel exhaust stream and turn it into safe 
                    water and nitrogen. It is made up of 32.5 percent urea and 67.5 percent deionized water and is a non-hazardous solution. It is consumed in a system called a selective
                     catalytic reduction (SCR).Diesel exhaust fluid does not come in contact with the diesel fuel in your truck and is stored in a completely separate tank.To make sure that the
                      engine reaches full combustion and to prevent exhausting fuel that is not burnt, diesel engines run with a specific air-to-fuel ratio. When there is excess air, the process 
                      creates nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides are harmful pollutants. Therefore, the SCR is required to reduce the amount of NOx emissions before it shoots out the exhaust pipe and 
                      pollutes the air.How diesel exhaust fluid DEF works within this system is all about chemistry. The diesel exhaust fluid is injected into the exhaust system. Its urea component
                       vaporizes and creates carbon dioxide and ammonia. Ammonia will “catalytically reduce” the amount of nitrogen oxides, turning it into regular nitrogen and water before being 
                       released through the exhaust steam. Both these elements are not harmful to the environment.</p>
