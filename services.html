            An engine diagnostic is a test which is performed to learn more about why an engine is not functioning properly.
            Engine diagnostics can be performed by skilled home mechanics with the proper equipment, or a car can be taken into a mechanic
             or dealer for diagnosis. The engine diagnostic is used to gather data which can be utilized in the repair of the vehicle, and it 
             can also be used during things like emissions testing, in which a car is checked to confirm that it adheres to emissions standards
            for vehicles in its class.</p>

                    An oil change and filter replacement is one of many preventative maintenance services
                     that help promote maximum vehicle performance while extending the life of your vehicle.
                      Oil is responsible for lubricating the working components inside your vehicle’s engine while
                       reducing the amount of friction between them. Because the engine generates a substantial
                        amount of heat, oil acts as a cooling agent as it circulates through the engine.
                         Oil also absorbs other harmful particles created during the combustion process
                          and directs them to the oil filter, which filters out the debris and contaminants
                           for clean, free-flowing oil. Together, the oil and oil filter keep your vehicle’s
                            engine operating at optimal levels of performance. During an oil change, we will
                             replace your engine’s old oil with new oil and replace the oil filter. We will also
                              lubricate the chassis components of the vehicle according to the standards of the
                               manufacturer. At the end of every lube, oil and filter change, our staff will have
                                ensured that your engine oil is clean and the working parts of your engine are properly
                                 lubricated.</p>

                <p class="pp6">
                    The air-conditioning evaporator is a small radiator inside the dashboard that provides cold air for the air-conditioning system.
                    It’s called the evaporator because it’s where the freezing liquid refrigerant takes on any heat from the air blown through it and
                     changes into a gaseous state (evaporating it) before returning it to the air-conditioning condenser to shed the heat; the process
                      is constantly repeated. The air that emerges from the air conditioner is cold as a result. The evaporator is typically hidden inside
                       the vehicle’s dashboard and can be labor-intensive to replace, which then requires a full system recharge. Unlike a ruptured heater
                        core, which can leak engine coolant into the foot wells, a leak in the evaporator releases only refrigerant vapor. A clogged drainage
                         channel is a common cause of water in the front foot wells.</p>

                            For our extensive Auto service, we also provide Brake Repair. As breaking is an essential
                             safety measure, you cannot ignore them. From drum brakes to hydraulic disks, as well as
                              anti-lock brake services are all performed in our facility, ensuring that they work perfectly.
                               If you’re planning to go for a long drive, we have special arrangements to prepare your car
                                quickly and affordably. We guarantee excellent service quality, whether in emergencies or regular
                                 maintenance work.Anti-lock brake systems (ABS) are designed to prevent your vehicle’s wheels from
                                  locking (and skidding) during emergency stops and other challenging conditions. How does ABS work? 
                                  Using electronic sensors and high-pressure pumps, under certain conditions, your ABS system can measure your vehicle’s
                                   speed, wheel slip and the force you apply to the brakes. When the sensors detect a skid hazard, your ABS actually pumps
                                    the brakes for you -- with more speed and precision than a human driver can achieve.</p>

                            The vast majority of modern vehicles are more computerized than ever before, and truth be told, that’s a good thing. In fact,
                             this computerization allows cars to be thoroughly checked with self-running diagnostic tests to keep your vehicle in optimal working order.
                              These tests can scan components and a car’s integrated systems for errors or malfunctions before they become truly dangerous.Besides mechanical maintenance,
                               electronic maintenance is also very critical. As these components work alongside the engine,
                             transmission, braking and even suspension, regular Car Computer Diagnostic assure a seamless operation. Thanks to improving
                              technologies, our professionals can easily connect the inspection console to the car’s ECU and find faults remotely. Once assessed,
                               the mechanic will then address the faulty area (if any) and re-run the program to assure perfection..</p>
